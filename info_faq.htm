        <font color="#FFFF00">Q]</font> <b><font color="#FFFF00">what style of 
        martial arts are all these tricks from?</font></b><br>
        <font color="#FFFF00">A]</font> theres no real traditional style here 
        really, all these moves are adapted from a bunch of styles, including 
        tae kwon do, wushu, capoeira, and so on.. <br>
        <br>
        <font color="#FFFF00">Q] <b>how long does it take to learn these moves?</b></font><b><br>
        </b><font color="#FFFF00">A]</font> it really depends on the person. if 
        you've had no real experience with martial arts you may find that it'll 
        take you quite a while, but for some people who have been doing martial 
        arts for a long time, picking up moves can be really fast. i think when 
        kelly started out with tricks, he already had 9 years of experience with 
        martial arts, and so he picked up 540, aerial, butterfly twist, doubleleg, 
        and backflip in maybe 6 months..? me on the other hand, i started with 
        about 5 years of experience, and it took me about a year and a half to 
        learn all that..<br>
        <br>
        <font color="#FFFF00">Q] <b>how should i start out learning tricks?</b></font><b><br>
        </b><font color="#FFFF00">A]</font> the most important thing is to practice 
        your basics, so you have good form and technique.. aside from that, just 
        start off with a &quot;gateway&quot; trick like 540, and build from that.. 
        aerial, twist, doubleleg, backflip, and then variations. once you learn 
        more stuff your confidence level goes up and you'll find it a lot easier 
        to attempt the harder tricks that you thought were impossible before..<br>
        <br>
        <font color="#FFFF00">Q] <b>how do i become flexible?</b></font><b><br>
        </b><font color="#FFFF00">A]</font> it takes a while to become flexible, 
        but if you stretch everyday and keep at it, you'll see improvement sooner 
        than you think. i think it took me a year of stretching everyday to get 
        left and right splits, and half a year from then on to get center splits.. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <font color="#FFFF00">Q] <b>how do i jump higher?</b></font><b><br>
        </b><font color="#FFFF00">A]</font> it depends, for some people, the only 
        way they get higher on moves is by practicing and learning different ways 
        to get momentum and throw your body. if you're like that then you should 
        just go out and keep practicing, and eventually, you'll naturally be able 
        to get higher on all your moves.. for other people, exercises help.. calf 
        raises in particular seem to work for a lot of people.. steve terada did 
        those and he said it helped him gain the muscle mass for his hops..<br>
        <br>
        <font color="#FFFF00">Q] <b>im not flexible and i can't jump high, can 
        i still throw tricks?</b></font><b><br>
        </b><font color="#FFFF00">A]</font> yeah! flexibility and jumping ability 
        only help in your learning.. i think the most important thing is still 
        technique.. flexibility and jumping ability come with time and practice, 
        dont be thrown off just because you dont have them at the start..<br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#FFFF00">Q] 
        <b>im a big guy, can i learn these tricks?</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><br>
        </b><font color="#FFFF00">A]</font> a lot of people ask me this question.. 
        i think that while some people have bodies that just make it easier to 
        learn kicks and others dont, being bigger than normal shouldn't stop you 
        from learning. technique is probably the most important thing. theres 
        some big people throwin tricks.. RJ who can 540, aerial, twist and handspring 
        is about 5'11 and 220 pounds? and my instructor at west coast is like 
        6'2 and 220 and can throw 540, sideswipe, and backflip..!!<b><br>
