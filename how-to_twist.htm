        make sure you've been swinging your arms, and that your chest is relatively 
        low and parallel to the ground. its important for you to start low, because 
        then you can get height when you jump.. if you start with your chest high 
        and try to twist, you'll most likely drill down into the ground.. keeping 
        your torso low chambers your weight so you can get your body UP when you 
        jump..</font></p>

    <td height="183" width="60%"> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">when you jump off, the most 
        important thing is... DON'T SPIN RIGHT AWAY!!! swing your leg up HARD, 
        and with that lift your chest up. try to get as much lift as possible 
        from your torso while keeping it relatively parallel to the ground. it 
        might help to tighten/flex your leg when you swing it up, that can bring 
        it up harder. lifting your leg and torso get you height.. but be sure 
        to STALL and get to the PEAK of your jump before you do any spinning! 
        if you've read the 540 tips then you'll know what im talkin about. the 
        same thing applies.. as soon as you spin you stop gaining height. so jump 
        FIRST and get as high as you possibly can before spinning. several things 
        can help with this... when you do butterfly kicks high you feel your chest 
        &quot;floating&quot; somewhat.. right? practice doing kicks and getting 
        that &quot;floating&quot; feeling.. that can help you time your twist, 
        since you're pretty much at the peak of your jump when you &quot;float&quot;..</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">twisting over isn't as hard 
        as it might look, but it takes some practice. its really really scary 
        at first but it should get easier after time. use your arms to help turn 
        you over. in the picture, you can see that larry's left arm is going back 
        in the direction of his kidney.. winding your arms around your body like 
        that works. to get even more spin, you can do this steve terada style 
        and do &quot;elbow strikes&quot; with your elbows.. that'll help force 
        your body over. when you're first learning, just try to get the spin down, 
        and dont worry about your legs. as you get better, you can start controlling 
        your legs. perfect form would be to have them straight.. for that you 
        should keep your leg muscles tightened and flexed the whole time, forcing 
        them to be straight during the entire move. you can also get your legs 
        to spin around like a &quot;blender&quot;.. meaning a kim do butterfly 
        twist for example. keep one leg tightened and totally straight (the one 
        you jump off with, in these pictures it'd be the left leg), and keep the 
        other leg bent. download the kim do butterfly twist clips and this is 
        exactly what he does. you can also keep both your legs bent, this is the 
        ugliest form but it makes you spin the fastest. it really helps to bend 
        both your legs when you're trying to learn more advanced twists like hypertwists 
        and doubletwists. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">when you're about done 
          doing the twisting, its time to land. again it can be really hard and 
          seemingly impossible at first but practice and you'll get it. for some 
          people it helps if they try to &quot;twist kick&quot; the ground when 
          they see it. basically just try and stick your leg down on the ground 
          when you see it. for some people its mental, they put their hands down 
          when they dont really need to. in this case you should think mentally 
          that you're gonna do a twist perfectly and land on your feet ONLY.. 
          that should help. if you find yourself crashing on your knees and side, 
          DONT WORRY.. its perfectly normal. just keep at it and go back to the 
          regular butterflies if you have to, but dont give up..</font></p>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">when you're able to land 
          a twist, you should probably just step out of it naturally, going with 
          the flow of the momentum. that way, its easier to learn how to combo 
          out of twists with 540 and wheel kick, etc. when you combo out of a 
          twist, its basically flowing with your momentum and using the momentum 
          you had as an advantage. in that sense 540s should be easier coming 
          out of twists.. because your body's already going in the right direction. 
          just practice the timing and you should get it. </font></p>
