      <p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">going into a doubleleg, 
        make sure your legs are comfortably spread apart.. just far apart enough 
        so that you can get a good jump, but close enough so that your legs will 
        be together when you kick. one important thing, i think, is to not lean 
        forward when you jump off. leaning forward before you takeoff will basically 
        make you travel, and when you travel in a forward direction you lose height. 
        so try to not lean, and that way more of your momentum will go up instead 
        of forward, which is good. watch alot of the doubleleg videos (and you 
        can see it in the pictures on the left), and you'll see that the really 
        good doubleleggers like kim dont have their chest leaning forward when 
        they jump, its almost straight up. if you find yourself travelling too 
        far forward, try to jump off sooner once you plant your feet - that might 
        help. also, look in the pictures and ull see that kims chest isnt totally 
        down like hes bent over, and its not straight up like hes standing.. its 
        sorta in between, like its tilted. thats a good way to think of it. dont 
        jump off with your chest parallel to the ground, or else you'll get no 
        height, but dont jump with your back straight up either, since that way 
        you won't be able to twist right..</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">now, look at the pictures 
        in the first step and look at the ones in this step.. you'll see that 
        kims torso twists _upwards_. it went from facing the ground to facing 
        the ceiling.. swing your arms so that you do this with your chest.. this 
        is exactly the reason you usually dont doubleleg the direction you 540. 
        when you 540 your chest turns from side to side, and when you doubleleg 
        your chest will turn from.. say ground to ceiling. its kind of a bad explanation 
        but try it out a feel times and hopefully you'll get it. try to jump as 
        high as you possibly can, and jerk your chest in the way just described. 
        wait until your chest has turned all the way, and then whip your legs 
        over. the reason that you wait for your chest to turn all the way is because 
        it will make your legs naturally follow. the harder your whip your torso, 
        the faster your legs will whip. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">while you're whipping your 
        legs over, try to keep them straight and together. to keep them straight, 
        it helps to tighten and/or flex your leg muscles from the start and keep 
        them that way. if you force yourself to keep your leg muscle tightened 
        like that, your legs will pretty much stay straight the entire time. to 
        keep your legs together, try to do it from the start. get your legs together 
        as soon as you get into the air. if your legs start together and then 
        spread apart during the kick, then its just a matter of forcing yourself 
        not to spread them. for example it might help if you imagine your ankles 
        are taped together.. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">at some point during the 
          kick you should torque over, so that you land facing backwards, instead 
          of sideways. this isnt really necessary but a lot of people do it and 
          it looks better, in my opinion. an easy way to do this torque is to 
          do it with your HIPS and not with your legs. if you focus on turning 
          your hips so that they're facing backwards when you land, it should 
          work out pretty well. you can play around with this and try turning 
          over your hips at different times.. really early, really late, whatever. 
          it changes the way the whole move looks.. for instance, it'll look much 
          more like a flip if you torque your hips really early. </font></p>

          you bend your knees like shocks, such as not to hurt your knees. i have 
          a problem doing this so i think ill be crippled when i grow up.. heh 
          heh. you'll know you're getting high on this move if you feel a split 
          second or two of hangtime, when you see the ground and are about to 
          land. kim lands really high and you can tell from the picture, since 
          his body isnt bent up at all.. hes almost totally standing. this is 
          a good sign.. try to practice this move so that your body is as open 
          as possible when it lands, instead of crunched up.. </font></p>
