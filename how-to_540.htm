        up you should start with your left leg in front (or which ever leg you're 
        not gonna kick with). of course theres other ways to learn like standing 
        and with some extra steps, but this is one of the most typical setups 
        so we'll use this...</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">now step forward with your 
        right leg, or your kicking leg. do this so that it gives you the most 
        momentum.. it works differently for everyone.. slow, fast, with a little 
        hop, whatever. also make sure you get a good pivot on that step. look 
        at the picture and you'll see that kelly's heel is pointing forward towards 
        where hes gonna kick.. if you dont pivot then you'll find yourself doing 
        alot more work then you really have to.. try it out and you'll see. also 
        swing your arms in this step, since it gives you more momentum. another 
        thing that might help at this point is staying lower to the ground, which 
        can help you &quot;chamber&quot; some weight and energy which will help 
        you get higher once you jump..</font></p>

    <td height="291" width="60%"> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">taking off.. try to use 
        everything you possibly can to get yourself higher. swing your arms up, 
        throw your chest up, and lift your nonkicking leg as high as you can. 
        when you bring that leg up its better to keep it straight at first, and 
        then bend it once the kick goes across. think whatever you need to, to 
        get that leg higher. for example you can imagine that left leg is trying 
        to crescent kick a high target.. etc. probably the MOST IMPORTANT thing 
        in this step that people don't do is they dont STALL!! when you watch 
        the crazy 540'ers like chris de vera and kelly in these pictures, they 
        get really high and seemingly float before they kick over. its hard and 
        i don't quite have it, but try really hard.. JUMP FIRST! and try to get 
        to the peak of your jump before you kick at all. it might be awkward feeling 
        but try to force yourself to do it. you stop getting higher the instant 
        you kick across.. so it makes sense to wait until you're at your peak 
        before kicking..</font></p>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">when you do the kick theres 
          a few different ways you can do it.. theres bent and straight legged 
          540s first of all. bending your leg and snapping it out can be easier 
          at first, but try to avoid it since its REALLY REALLY bad for your knee.. 
          straight legged 540s look smoother and better since the kick has a wider 
          arc.. you can also 540 doing crescent or roundhouse kicks. crescents 
          tend to look better, but they're slower than roundhouses, and they put 
          your hips in a bad position if you want to do a jacknife. so if you 
          wanna jacknife your 540 you should turn your hips over and do roundhouse 
          instead of crescent.. aside from all that technical stuff, try to use 
          your abs to help whip your kick over. also, if you brought your nonkicking 
          leg up straight, then this is when you'll bend it, to help facilitate 
          the landing. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Tahoma, Arial" size="2">when you come out of a 
          540 try to do it as lightly as possible. it can be rough at first and 
          you might hurt your ankle, but that will go away over time, especially 
          if you get higher and overrotate just a bit, then its a lot easier on 
          your joints. if you wanna combo your 540, then you should try and stop 
          yourself after you land, so you're stable enough for a wheel kick. if 
          you're not combo'ing it then just naturally spin out of it.. and if 
          you're high enough you can try spinning extra before landing.. bring 
          your arms in, and use your abs and shoulders to torque.</font></p>
